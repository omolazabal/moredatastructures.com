# CSUF Supplemental Instruction
This website is intended to be a supplement to Oscar's assigned CPSC 131 Data Structures [Supplemental Instruction][1] session.

As a result, the content on this website will be completely wiped and re-developed at the beginning of every California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) semester. Topics are released on a rolling basis. Release dates are based off what the 131 professors have covered so far.

Additionally, this means that some of the content on here may be difficult to understand if you do not attend the SI sessions. Please utilize the comment sections if you are having trouble and are unable to make the SI sessions.
