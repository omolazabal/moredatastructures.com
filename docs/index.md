# CSUF Supplemental Instruction
This website is intended to be a supplement to Oscar's assigned CPSC 131 Data Structures [Supplemental Instruction][1] session. As a result, the content on this website will be completely wiped and re-developed at the beginning of every California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) semester. Topics are released on a rolling basis. Release dates are based off what the 131 professors have covered so far.
