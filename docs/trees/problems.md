## Terminology
1. What is a root node?
2. What is the difference between depth, height, and level?
3. What is a:
    - Ancestor
    - Sibiling
    - Child
    - Parent
4. What are internal nodes? Leaf nodes?

## Traversals
## ![](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/binary-tree-to-DLL.png)
1. What distinguishes each traversal type (preorder, inorder, postorder) from each other?
2. Write the order in which the nodes are visited when performing the following traversals:
    - Preorder
    - Inorder
    - Postorder

## Tree Types
## ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/BSTSearch.png)
1. Is the tree above full, complete, or perfect?
2. If needed, how would you modify the tree so it will become only:
    - Full
    - Complete
    - Perfect

### Tree Type Definitions
|Type|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Full| Every node contains 0 or 2 children|
|Complete| All levels, except possibly the last level, are completely full and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible|
|Perfect| All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level|
